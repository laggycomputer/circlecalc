# circlecalc
A program for circle calculation, complicated into a .deb package. Includes a manpage o.o. Really a simple C++ coding project gone too far haha
There is an included checksum file, `SHA256SUM`. It is used to verify `circlecalc-1.0.0.deb`, see below.
#Verifying the .deb
Requires `sha265sum` to be installed.
Simply generate a checksum of the .deb (`sha256sum circlecalc-1.0.0.deb`), and compare the result to the included checksum file.
